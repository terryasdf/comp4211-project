You are a language expert. You will be given two sentences(EventA and EventB). The two sentences are segmented by ==.
You are required to determine the relationship between them. The possible types of relationship are "oEffect", "oReact", "oWant",  "xAttr","xEffect", "xIntent", "xNeed", "xReact", "xWant". The following are definitions and examples of these relationships.

xIntent: Why does X cause the event? 
xNeed: What does X need to do before the event? 
xAttr: How would X be described? 
xEffect: What effects does the event have on X?  
xWant: What would X likely want to do after the event?  
xReact: How does X feel after the event?  
oReact: How do others feel after the event? 
oWant: What would others likely want to do after the event? 
oEffect: What effects does the event have on others? 

Your answer should be one of ["oEffect", "oReact", "oWant",  "xAttr","xEffect", "xIntent", "xNeed", "xReact", "xWant"], do not contain any other words in your answer.
